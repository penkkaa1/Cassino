Writing this at the start of week 2, after exam week.
Last week I got most of the basic classes programmed, or at least the first versions of them. I already found things I needed to add,
or things I actually did not need whilst programming these classes. I based the classes mostly on the UML-drawing which I did. The Game-class
is still a work-in-progress. I did not have a clear vision on which functions etc. I could program at this phase. I will look into that.

The functions I programmed were mostly just removing and adding cards to the deck, hand and table. But I also put in some effort to help
myself and making the program more aesthetically pleasing by focusing on the toString methods, for instance for the Card class.

I tested almost all of the functions I did in just Scala REPL, and they seem to be working fine. Granted, they are very basic functions,
but still, progress. Next step would be finish up Game-class, and then move on to the human-algorithm / game portion of this project.
There is a bit of pressure coming from other classes in real life. We started Programming 2, a new Physics class, we have the Databases
course going on, so I try to update this project whenever I have free time. Unfortunately, free time seems a bit scarce at the moment.
With so many deadlines during the week (about 4-6), we will see how the schedule holds up.

I'm falling behind the schedule at the moment, but I'm trying to catch up. I tried implementing a bare-bones version of the Game, and started testing the text-based interface aswell.
Ran into some problems, and I also need to add exceptions. At the moment the only acceptable case is the one with no corruptions etc etc.
Programming 2 has taken a large portion of my "free" time, and I also attended Titeenit on the last weekend. I will try to catch up on the following weeks.

Massive progress since last update. I basically now have a playable, winnable text-based game with 2-N players. I added exceptions for user inputs,
so far in my testing everything works. However, with more than ~2 players the deck gets too small, and because of that some duplicate cards get inputted into the game.
I sent an email regarding the subject. Next stop is the saving and loading, round system, and the more cards / decks being added with player count. After that, it's on to the GUI.
I feel very positive at the moment. However I do have some IRL stuff coming up, for instance moving houses on the 17th. I will try to keep up the productivity I've had today and
the past days.
